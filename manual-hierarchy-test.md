# Manual Test to Verify Hierarchy Fix

## Steps:

1. Open browser console (F12) and go to http://localhost:5174
2. Register/login with test account
3. Create this exact structure:
   - Type "MAIN" and press Enter
   - Press Tab (to indent)
   - Type "SUB1" and press Enter  
   - Press Tab (to indent further)
   - Type "SUBSUB" and press Enter

4. Check console logs for:
   - "RAW BACKEND ITEMS:" - should show tree structure
   - "CONVERTED ITEMS:" - should show items with level: 0, 1, 2
   - "FLATTENED FOR DISPLAY:" - should show correct levels
   - "FLAT ITEMS FOR RENDER:" - should show correct padding

5. Click Logout

6. Login again with same account

7. Check console logs again for the same debug output

## What to look for:

After login, the console should show:
- RAW BACKEND ITEMS with nested children structure
- CONVERTED ITEMS with level: 0 for MAIN, level: 1 for SUB1, level: 2 for SUBSUB
- FLAT ITEMS FOR RENDER with padding: 8px, 32px, 56px respectively

If levels are all 0 or undefined, the conversion is failing.
If levels are correct but padding is wrong, the rendering is failing.
