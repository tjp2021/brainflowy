# Inline AI Buttons - Manual Testing Guide

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Inline AI Buttons on Each Outline Item**
- Added a Sparkles (✨) icon button that appears on hover for each outline item
- Located to the right of the item text
- Only visible when hovering over the item (opacity transition)
- Purple color scheme to match AI Assistant branding

### 2. **Functionality**
- **Clicking inline button**: Opens AI Assistant panel in **Edit mode** with that specific item selected
- **Shows context**: Panel displays "Editing: [item text]" to confirm which item is being edited
- **Auto-detects section**: Tries to identify which Brainlift section the item belongs to

### 3. **Main AI Assistant Button**
- Still available at the bottom toolbar
- Opens panel in **Create mode** for general content creation
- No specific item context

## How to Test Manually

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

2. **Login with test credentials**:
   - Email: test@brainflowy.com
   - Password: password123

3. **Create some test items**:
   - Click "Add new item"
   - Type some text
   - Press Enter

4. **Test inline AI buttons**:
   - Hover over any outline item
   - You should see a purple sparkles icon appear on the right
   - Click it
   - The AI Assistant panel should slide in from the right
   - It should show "Edit" mode is active (blue background)
   - It should display "Editing: [your item text]" below the mode buttons

5. **Test main AI Assistant button**:
   - Click "AI Assistant" button in the bottom toolbar
   - Panel should open in "Create" mode
   - No specific item should be selected

## Expected Behavior

### When clicking inline AI button:
- Panel opens from the right
- "Edit" mode is automatically selected
- Shows which item is being edited
- Placeholder text says "How should I edit this?"
- Mock responses will edit that specific item when submitted

### When clicking main AI button:
- Panel opens from the right  
- "Create" mode is selected by default
- No item context shown
- Placeholder text says "Ask me to create content..."
- Mock responses will create new items when submitted

## Code Changes Made

1. **OutlineDesktop.tsx**:
   - Added inline Sparkles button to each outline item (line ~1498-1507)
   - Button only visible on hover with `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`
   - Calls `openLLMAssistantForItem(item)` when clicked
   - Main AI Assistant button now explicitly clears context

2. **LLMAssistantPanel.tsx**:
   - Already supported showing current item context
   - Auto-switches to Edit mode when an item is provided
   - Shows "Editing: [item text]" when in edit mode

## Visual Design

- **Inline button**: Small, subtle, only appears on hover
- **Purple theme**: Consistent with AI/magic metaphor
- **Smooth transitions**: 200ms opacity transition for nice UX
- **Clear context**: Always shows what's being edited

## Next Steps

The frontend is now complete with:
- ✅ Panel component with mock responses
- ✅ Three modes (Create, Edit, Research)  
- ✅ Inline AI buttons for item-specific editing
- ✅ Main AI button for general creation
- ✅ Context awareness (knows which item/section)

Ready for backend API integration to replace mock responses with real LLM calls.
