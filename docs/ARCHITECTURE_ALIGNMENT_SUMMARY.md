# Architecture Alignment Summary

## Changes Made (January 15, 2025)

### Database Decision: Cosmos DB over PostgreSQL
Aligned all Task Master tasks with the architecture decision documented in `BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` to use Azure Cosmos DB instead of PostgreSQL with ltree.

## Updated Tasks

### ✅ Task 3.1: Design Database Schema
**Before**: PostgreSQL with ltree extension  
**After**: Cosmos DB document schema with hierarchical JSON structure
- Document structure with nested items array
- Partition key strategy using userId
- Indexing policies for hierarchical queries

### ✅ Task 14.2: Configure Database
**Before**: PostgreSQL with ltree extension and Redis for caching  
**After**: Azure Cosmos DB with Core SQL API
- Cosmos DB emulator for local development
- Users and Docs containers with userId partition keys
- Built-in performance optimization (no separate Redis needed)

### ✅ Task 14.4: Build Hierarchical Storage
**Before**: PostgreSQL ltree for hierarchical operations  
**After**: Cosmos DB document structure
- Single document per outline with nested items
- Native JSON support for simpler operations
- Optimistic concurrency control

### ✅ Task 14.7: Search Functionality
**Before**: PostgreSQL full-text search with Redis caching  
**After**: Cosmos DB built-in query capabilities
- CONTAINS and LIKE operators for search
- Integration points for Azure Cognitive Search
- Cosmos DB indexing policies for performance

## Remaining PostgreSQL References

Some task descriptions still contain PostgreSQL references but the critical subtasks have been updated with the Cosmos DB approach via timestamped additions. The main task descriptions (Tasks 1, 14) could not be directly updated due to their completion status or validation issues, but the subtasks contain the correct implementation details.

## Architecture Benefits

### Why Cosmos DB?
1. **Perfect JSON Alignment**: Outline data is already hierarchical JSON
2. **Simplicity**: No ORM needed, direct document operations
3. **Performance**: <10ms point reads, automatic indexing
4. **Cost**: Free tier handles significant load
5. **Scalability**: Built for global distribution when needed

### Implementation Path
1. **Phase 2 (Current)**: Cosmos DB only - simple, fast to market
2. **Phase 3 (Future)**: Optional Fluid Framework for real-time collaboration
3. **Migration Path**: Easy to add features without changing core storage

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Phase 2**: Implement backend with Cosmos DB
2. **Use TDD Approach**: Tests already written from mock services
3. **Follow Simple Path**: Ship MVP with Cosmos DB
4. **Future Enhancement**: Add Fluid Framework only if real-time collaboration needed

## Files Updated
- `/docs/BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Already specified Cosmos DB
- `/docs/FLUID_COSMOS_INTEGRATION.md` - Created integration strategy
- `/docs/ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- `/.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` - Subtasks updated with Cosmos DB approach
