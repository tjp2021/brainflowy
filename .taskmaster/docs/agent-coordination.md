- Prepare components for Phase 3 integration
- Update mock data to match backend specifications

**Phase 3 Activities (Collaboration):**
- Replace mock services with real API calls
- Implement React component testing
- Handle frontend integration challenges
- Optimize mobile performance

### Agent B: Backend Developer (Phase 2 Lead)
**Primary Focus:** TDD implementation following UI-driven API contracts

**Phase 1 Activities (Planning):**
- Review Agent A's API contract documentation
- Validate technical feasibility of UI requirements
- Plan database schema based on UI data needs

**Phase 2 Responsibilities (Lead):**
- Implement FastAPI backend using TDD methodology
- Follow Agent A's API contracts EXACTLY
- Build PostgreSQL schema with ltree extension
- Implement Redis caching and session management
- Create comprehensive test suite
- Ensure performance requirements are met

**Phase 3 Activities (Collaboration):**
- Support frontend integration
- Implement real voice AI backend services
- Handle backend optimization and scaling
- Support production deployment

## Phase Transition Coordination

### Phase 1 → Phase 2 Handoff

**Agent A Deliverables:**
1. **API Contract Documentation** (OpenAPI/Swagger format)
   - All endpoints with HTTP methods
   - Request/response schemas
   - Authentication requirements
   - Error handling specifications
   - WebSocket requirements for real-time features

2. **Mock Data Structures**
   - JSON examples for all API responses
   - Database schema implications
   - Hierarchical data patterns for ltree

3. **Performance Requirements**
   - UI-discovered performance constraints
   - Mobile optimization requirements
   - Real-time sync expectations

4. **Working Prototype**
   - Demonstrable UI with all interactions
   - Validated user workflows
   - Mobile gesture implementations

**Agent B Acceptance Criteria:**
- API contracts are technically implementable
- Data structures are database-efficient
- Performance requirements are realistic
- All UI needs are covered by API specifications

### Phase 2 → Phase 3 Handoff

**Agent B Deliverables:**
1. **Working Backend APIs**
   - All endpoints from Phase 1 contracts implemented
   - Comprehensive test suite (unit + integration)
   - Performance benchmarks meeting requirements
   - Docker development environment

2. **API Documentation**
   - OpenAPI documentation with examples
   - Authentication flow documentation
   - Error handling documentation
   - Deployment instructions

3. **Database and Infrastructure**
   - PostgreSQL with ltree configured
   - Redis caching operational
   - Migration system in place

**Agent A Acceptance Criteria:**
- APIs match original UI requirements
- Response formats are compatible with frontend code
- Performance meets mobile app requirements
- Error handling supports good UX

## Decision Framework

### When to Iterate Back vs. Move Forward

**Iterate Back to Previous Phase:**
- **Core UX Changes:** Fundamental workflow modifications
- **API Structure Problems:** Backend can't efficiently implement UI requirements
- **Performance Issues:** UI requirements exceed backend capabilities
- **User Testing Failures:** Major usability problems discovered

**Move Forward with Adjustments:**
- **Performance Optimizations:** Backend improvements that don't affect UI
- **Infrastructure Concerns:** Deployment/scaling issues
- **Nice-to-Have Features:** Non-critical enhancements
- **Error Handling Improvements:** Better error states without UX changes

### Communication Protocol

**Daily Coordination:**
- Update task status in Taskmaster
- Document any blockers or dependencies
- Flag potential API contract changes

**Phase Transition Meetings:**
- Review all deliverables before handoff
- Validate acceptance criteria
- Identify any iteration needs
- Plan next phase coordination

**Issue Escalation:**
- Technical feasibility concerns → Immediate discussion
- Performance requirement conflicts → Back-iteration consideration
- User feedback requiring changes → Phase reassessment

## Technical Coordination Guidelines

### API Contract Management
1. **Agent A owns API design** based on UI needs
2. **Agent B validates feasibility** and suggests optimizations
3. **Changes require mutual agreement** and documentation update
4. **Version control** all API contract changes

### Data Structure Coordination
1. **Agent A defines data shapes** based on UI needs
2. **Agent B optimizes for database efficiency**
3. **Mock data should match production data** structures
4. **Hierarchical data follows ltree patterns**

### Performance Coordination
1. **Agent A defines UX performance requirements**
2. **Agent B implements to meet or exceed requirements**
3. **Mobile-first approach** guides all performance decisions
4. **Measure and optimize** throughout development

### Testing Strategy Coordination
1. **Agent A focuses on** component and UI interaction testing
2. **Agent B focuses on** API and database testing
3. **Both collaborate on** integration and e2e testing
4. **Shared test data** for consistency across layers

## Success Metrics by Agent

### Agent A Success Metrics
- **Phase 1:** Working prototype with all UI interactions
- **Phase 2:** API contracts stable and comprehensive
- **Phase 3:** Smooth frontend-backend integration

### Agent B Success Metrics
- **Phase 1:** Technical validation of UI requirements
- **Phase 2:** Backend passes all tests and meets performance requirements
- **Phase 3:** Production-ready backend with monitoring

### Joint Success Metrics
- **Phase Transitions:** Clean handoffs with no major issues
- **Integration:** Real application works as well as prototype
- **Production:** Application meets all PRD requirements

This coordination strategy ensures both agents can work efficiently while maintaining system coherence and user experience quality.
