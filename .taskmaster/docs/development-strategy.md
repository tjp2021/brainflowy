# BrainFlowy Development Strategy

## Three-Phase UI-Driven Development with Multi-Agent Claude

### Overview
BrainFlowy will be developed using a UI-first, three-phase approach with two Claude Code agents working in sequence and parallel to deliver a high-quality MVP quickly.

### Development Philosophy
- **UI-Driven Development**: User interface needs drive backend API design
- **Prototype First**: Get working interactions ASAP for user testing
- **TDD Backend**: Solid backend foundation through test-driven development
- **Clean Integration**: Both pieces proven solid before integration

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: UI-First Prototype (Agent A: Frontend Prototyper)
**Goal**: Working prototype with full user interactions using mock data

**Agent A Responsibilities:**
- Build mobile-first React components with TypeScript
- Implement all user interactions (swipe gestures, voice workflow, touch targets)
- Create realistic mock services and data
- Define API contracts based on UI needs
- Validate UX through prototype testing
- Document API requirements for Agent B

**Deliverables:**
- Working React prototype with all MVP interactions
- Mock data services that feel realistic
- API contract documentation (endpoints, request/response structures)
- Component architecture that will support real backend integration

**Success Criteria:**
- All core user workflows functional with mocks
- Mobile interactions feel natural and responsive
- Voice workflow complete with mock AI responses
- API contracts stable and comprehensive
- Prototype ready for user testing

### Phase 2: Backend TDD Implementation (Agent B: Backend Developer)
**Goal**: Robust backend implementation using Test-Driven Development

**Agent B Responsibilities:**
- Implement FastAPI backend following Agent A's API contracts
- Use TDD methodology (Red → Green → Refactor)
- Build PostgreSQL schema with ltree for hierarchical data
- Implement Redis caching and session management
- Create real API endpoints that match Agent A's specifications
- Ensure performance requirements (10k+ items, <2s load times)

**Deliverables:**
- FastAPI backend with all endpoints from Phase 1 contracts
- PostgreSQL database with ltree extension configured
- Redis integration for caching and sessions
- Comprehensive test suite (unit and integration tests)
- Docker development environment
- Performance benchmarks meeting requirements

**Success Criteria:**
- All API endpoints implemented and tested
- Database handles hierarchical data efficiently
- Performance requirements met
- Backend deployable independently
- Mock data from Phase 1 can be replaced seamlessly

**Parallel Work During Phase 2:**
- Agent A continues UI refinement based on prototype feedback
- Agent A prepares frontend for Phase 3 integration
- Both agents can work simultaneously after Phase 1 API contracts are defined

### Phase 3: Integration & Full Testing (Both Agents)
**Goal**: Production-ready application with full functionality

**Both Agents Collaborate:**
- Replace frontend mock services with real API calls
- Integration testing between frontend and backend
- Add comprehensive frontend component tests (Agent A)
- Add end-to-end tests covering full user workflows
- Implement real voice AI integration (Whisper + Claude)
- Deploy to production infrastructure
- Performance optimization and monitoring

**Deliverables:**
- Fully integrated application
- Real voice AI functionality
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, e2e)
- Production deployment
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- User documentation

**Success Criteria:**
- All user workflows work with real backend
- Voice AI integration functional and responsive
- Application meets all performance requirements
- Zero data loss, robust error handling
- Ready for user onboarding

## Agent Coordination Strategy

### API Contract Handoff (Phase 1 → Phase 2)
1. Agent A documents all API requirements based on UI needs
2. Agent A provides mock data structures that backend must match
3. Agent B implements exactly to Agent A's specifications
4. Any backend constraints discovered in Phase 2 trigger discussion with Agent A

### Integration Handoff (Phase 2 → Phase 3)
1. Agent B provides working backend with documented endpoints
2. Agent A integrates real API calls systematically
3. Both agents collaborate on testing and optimization
4. Issues trigger back-and-forth refinement

### Decision Framework
**Forward-Only Changes:** Performance optimizations, infrastructure details, deployment concerns
**Back-Iteration Required:** Core UX changes, major API structure problems, user workflow modifications

## Technical Stack Alignment

### Frontend (Agent A)
- React with TypeScript
- Zustand for state management
- Mobile-first responsive design
- PWA capabilities
- Mock services architecture that can be swapped for real APIs

### Backend (Agent B)
- FastAPI with Python
- PostgreSQL with ltree extension
- Redis for caching and sessions
- SQLAlchemy ORM
- Comprehensive API documentation

### Integration (Both)
- Docker containerization
- Real-time sync with WebSockets
- Voice AI with Whisper + Claude
- Production deployment pipeline

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 Success
- Prototype demonstrates all core interactions
- User testing validates UX decisions
- API contracts are clear and stable
- Development velocity is high

### Phase 2 Success
- Backend passes all TDD tests
- Performance benchmarks met
- API matches Phase 1 contracts exactly
- Backend can be deployed independently

### Phase 3 Success
- Full application meets PRD requirements
- Performance targets achieved (<2s load, <500ms voice)
- User workflows work end-to-end
- Ready for production launch

This approach maximizes development speed while ensuring quality through clear phase transitions and agent specialization.
