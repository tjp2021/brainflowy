# Best Practices for Creating an Effective Brainlift

## Purpose Section

### What Makes a Good Purpose:
- **Specific and Measurable**: Clearly states what decision needs to be made or problem needs to be solved
- **Action-Oriented**: Written as "To decide..." or "To determine..." rather than vague statements
- **Time-Bound**: Includes when the decision needs to be made
- **Stakeholder-Clear**: Identifies who needs to make the decision

### Mediocre Purpose Examples:
- ❌ "To discuss marketing strategy"
- ❌ "To think about product improvements"
- ✅ "To decide between investing $2M in Product A or Product B by Q3 2024"

## Initiative Overview

### Optimal Level of Detail:
- **Executive Summary Length**: 3-5 paragraphs maximum

### Key Components:
- Current situation/context
- Problem or opportunity being addressed
- Proposed solution(s)
- Expected impact/outcomes
- Critical constraints or dependencies

### Quality Indicators:
- Uses concrete data points and metrics
- Avoids jargon and technical details
- Provides enough context for someone unfamiliar with the project
- Highlights what's at stake (risks/opportunities)

## SPOV (Single Point of View) Best Practices

### What Constitutes Valid SPOV Evidence:

#### Quantitative Evidence:
- Actual performance metrics from similar initiatives
- Market research data with sample sizes
- Financial projections based on historical data
- A/B test results with statistical significance

#### Qualitative Evidence:
- Customer interviews (with number of participants)
- Expert opinions from credible sources
- Competitive analysis with specific examples
- Case studies from comparable situations

### Strong SPOV Characteristics:
- **Clear Recommendation**: Takes a definitive stance, not just presents options
- **Evidence Hierarchy**: Leads with strongest evidence first
- **Addresses Counter-arguments**: Acknowledges weaknesses and alternative views
- **Risk Assessment**: Honestly evaluates what could go wrong
- **Success Metrics**: Defines how success will be measured

## Section-by-Section Quality Criteria

### 1. Background/Context
- **Good**: Provides 2-3 key historical points that directly relate to the decision
- **Mediocre**: Includes extensive history that doesn't impact current decision

### 2. Options Analysis
**Good:**
- Presents 2-4 viable options
- Uses consistent evaluation criteria
- Includes a "do nothing" option when relevant
- Quantifies trade-offs

**Mediocre:**
- Lists too many options (analysis paralysis)
- Uses different criteria for each option
- Presents obviously inferior options

### 3. Recommendation
**Good:**
- Clear, single recommendation
- Backed by 3-5 strongest pieces of evidence
- Includes implementation timeline
- Addresses resource requirements

**Mediocre:**
- Hedges with multiple recommendations
- Relies on opinion without evidence
- Lacks practical next steps

### 4. Risks and Mitigation
**Good:**
- Identifies 3-5 major risks
- Assigns probability and impact
- Provides specific mitigation strategies
- Includes early warning indicators

**Mediocre:**
- Generic risk statements
- No mitigation plans
- Overly optimistic or pessimistic

### 5. Decision Required
**Good:**
- Specific ask with clear options (e.g., "Approve $X budget for Y")
- Deadline for decision
- Clear escalation path if no decision

**Mediocre:**
- Vague requests for "support" or "buy-in"
- No urgency or timeline

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- **Information Overload**: Including every possible detail
- **Buried Lead**: Hiding the recommendation deep in the document
- **Weak Evidence**: Relying on anecdotes over data
- **Missing Stakeholder Perspectives**: Not addressing concerns of key decision makers
- **Unrealistic Timelines**: Not accounting for dependencies and risks

## Success Metrics for a Brainlift:
- Decision made within proposed timeline
- Stakeholders feel well-informed
- Limited follow-up questions needed
- Clear accountability established
- Measurable outcomes defined
